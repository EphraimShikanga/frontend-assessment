# Co-operative Bank — Product Dashboard

A frontend assessment for Co-operative Bank of Kenya. An authenticated product dashboard built with React 19, Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and TanStack Query.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture Decisions

I structured this project around a **component-driven architecture** with clear separation of concerns. Every piece of UI is a self-contained, reusable component, and all business logic (API calls, auth state, data fetching) is extracted into custom hooks and a centralised config layer.

For **state management**, I deliberately chose **React Context + TanStack Query** over Redux. The auth state (user session, login/logout) lives in an `AuthProvider` context, while all server state (products, search results) is managed by TanStack Query. I felt Redux would be unnecessary overhead here — Context handles the client state cleanly, and TanStack Query handles the server state with built-in caching, deduplication, and background refetching. That said, TanStack Query was a quick implementation from a one-day reading of the docs, so I may not have implemented everything in TanStack perfectly, but I believe I've been able to use it the right way — query keys as a factory, appropriate `staleTime`/`gcTime`, and mutations with proper error handling.

### Authentication (Part 1)

I built the login flow with a `useLogin` hook that wraps a TanStack Query `useMutation`. The form performs **client-side validation** first (required field checks), then sends credentials to the DummyJSON `/auth/login` endpoint. On success, the user object is persisted to `sessionStorage` via a dedicated `auth-storage` module and the `AuthContext` is updated, triggering a redirect to the dashboard. On failure, the API error message surfaces in an `AlertBanner` component.

The password field has a **visibility toggle** for usability. All form fields use a reusable `InputField` component built with `forwardRef` so the form can programmatically focus the first errored field.

### Protected Dashboard (Part 2)

Route protection is handled by an `AuthGuard` component at the **layout level** (`dashboard/layout.tsx`). This checks the auth context and redirects unauthenticated users back to login. The dashboard header displays the logged-in user's initials and name, plus a logout button that clears the session and redirects home.

### Products Listing (Part 3)

Product fetching is handled through a `useProducts` hook that calls `fetchProducts` — which maps the app's 1-based page index to DummyJSON's `skip`/`limit` parameters. I specifically designed this to **handle large catalogues (50,000+ products)** by:

- **Server-side pagination**: Only requesting one page worth of data at a time. The server does the heavy lifting.
- **Field projection**: The API call includes a `select` parameter that only requests the fields I actually render (`id,title,description,price,discountPercentage,category,rating,stock,brand,thumbnail,images`). This reduces payload size significantly at scale.
- **TanStack Query caching**: `staleTime` is set to 5 minutes and `gcTime` to 30 minutes, so navigating back to previously visited pages is instant — the cached data is served immediately without a network request.
- **React.memo on ProductCard**: Each card component is wrapped in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders during state changes that don't affect the card's props.

The pagination component uses an **ellipsis-based window strategy** — it always shows the first and last page, a window around the current page, and collapses gaps into "…". This keeps the UI compact even with thousands of pages.

I implemented three UI states beyond the happy path: **skeleton loaders** (structural wireframes that mirror the exact card layout), an **error state** with a retry button, and an **empty state** with a helpful message.

### Sidebar Navigation

The dashboard features a **sidebar with three menu items**: Dashboard (active), Transactions (enabled placeholder), and Reports (disabled). The sidebar uses a gold left-border accent on the active item.

The Transactions page is intentionally a placeholder — its purpose is to demonstrate TanStack Query's **stale-while-revalidate caching**. When you navigate from Dashboard → Transactions → back to Dashboard, the products load **instantly from cache** while TanStack Query silently refetches fresh data in the background. The UI updates seamlessly when the new data arrives, with no loading spinners or layout shifts. This means the user only sees skeleton loaders on the very first visit or after a hard refresh or when searching — all subsequent navigations feel instant.

The sidebar is also **fully responsive**: on mobile, it collapses behind a floating action button, and on desktop (lg+) it's always visible.

### Search (Part 4)

Search uses the DummyJSON `/products/search?q=query` endpoint for **server-side, case-insensitive filtering**. I didn't do client-side filtering because it's not viable with large datasets.

To avoid firing a network request on every keystroke, I built a **`useDebounce` hook** that delays the search query by 300ms. The raw input value is managed by the parent for immediate responsiveness — the user sees their typing reflected instantly — while the debounced value is what actually triggers the API call through the TanStack Query key. When the debounced value changes, the page resets to 1 automatically.

The search input has a **loading spinner** that appears when the debounced value differs from the raw input (i.e. typing is still settling) or when TanStack Query is fetching. It also has a clear button that resets the search and refocuses the input.

### Product Details Modal

Clicking any product card opens a **native `<dialog>` element** — I chose this over a custom modal because it provides built-in accessibility: focus trapping, Escape key handling, and proper ARIA semantics out of the box. The modal shows the full product info including a discount price calculation, stock status indicator (green/yellow/red dot), brand, category badge, and description.

The dialog has a backdrop click handler (clicking outside closes it) and a CSS animation for the open transition.

### Theming & Dark Mode

I set up the design system using **Tailwind CSS v4's `@theme inline` directive** with CSS custom properties. The architecture works like this:

1. `:root` defines all light-mode CSS variables
2. `.dark` overrides those variables with dark-mode values
3. `@theme inline` maps each variable to a Tailwind utility via `var()`

This means `bg-surface`, `text-text-primary`, `border-border-muted`, etc. automatically resolve to the correct value based on which mode is active — **zero `dark:` prefixes in any component file**. Every component only uses semantic tokens like `text-primary`, `text-secondary`, `text-muted`, `brand-text`, `brand-surface`, `badge-bg`, `skeleton`, and `interactive-hover`.

The theme toggle persists the user's preference to `localStorage` and toggles a `.dark` class on the `<html>` element.

### SVGs

The SVG icons throughout the app (building icon, search, chevrons, star rating, eye toggle, etc.) were generated with AI assistance. I didn't use an icon library to keep the bundle lean.
